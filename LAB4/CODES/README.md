# Scenario 22 — Sliding Puzzle

A terminal sliding puzzle with configurable board size and legal blank-space moves.

## Provided files

- `main.py` — entry point.
- `game.py` — interaction, timer, and move tracking.
- `puzzle.py` — puzzle representation and movement rules.
- `requirements.txt` — dependency declaration.

## Setup

```bash
python main.py
```

## Before changing the code

Start several puzzles and inspect the initial boards. Think about whether arbitrary
permutations can always be reached from the solved state using legal moves.

## Task 1 — Guarantee solvable starting states

Change puzzle initialisation so every generated board is reachable from the solved
arrangement. Prefer generating the solved board and applying legal blank moves to
scramble it.

**Done when:** repeated fresh puzzles are solvable in principle and the puzzle never
starts in an unreachable parity state.

## Task 2 — Complete puzzle lifecycle

Detect the solved arrangement and end the game cleanly. Prevent commands from changing
state after completion.

## Task 3 — Size, timer, and move modes

Add 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 modes. Track moves and elapsed time consistently across all sizes.
Do not reset session values accidentally when only the board is recreated.

## Task 4 — Valid-action feedback

Only report a successful slide when a tile actually moved into the blank. Invalid moves
must not increment the move count or generate success feedback.

## Required testing

Generate many fresh boards, test all sizes, solve a small board, attempt impossible
moves, verify move counts, verify timer behaviour, test invalid commands, and quit.


## LLM usage

You may use an LLM during the lab. The goal is to use it as a coding assistant while
retaining responsibility for understanding and testing the result.

- Inspect the existing code before asking for changes.
- Ask for explanations when you do not understand a proposed change.
- Test generated code against the stated behaviour and edge cases.
- Keep your complete LLM chat history for submission.
- Do not replace the whole project with an unrelated implementation.
- Keep all state in memory; do not add CSV, JSON, SQLite, or other persistence.

## Submission checklist

- [ ] Task 1 completed and the original defect was reproduced and fixed.
- [ ] Tasks 2–4 completed and tested.
- [ ] Boundary and invalid-input cases tested.
- [ ] No unnecessary external dependencies added.
- [ ] No persistent storage added.
- [ ] Code remains understandable and modular.
- [ ] Complete LLM chat-history link included.

## Submission Checklist

Submission is only the following three things:

- [ ] A 10-second video of gameplay **before** your changes, showing the bug/broken behavior
- [ ] A 10-second video of gameplay **after** your changes, showing the bug fixed and the new features working
- [ ] The Chat/LLM used page link, with the complete chat history
